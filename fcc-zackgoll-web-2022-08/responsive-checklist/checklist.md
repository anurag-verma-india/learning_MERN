# Checklist of responsive design

1. **Fluid Layouts** - Layout should rearrange itself
2. **Images** - Appropriate aspect ratio for each device
3. **Text** - "comfortable" size and spacing for every device. (body text around 16px, and not more than 700px wide)
4. **Overflow** - Nothing should overflow
5. **Full Width on mobile** - (In general) No columns on mobile, make each column everything 100%
6. **General Usability:**
   - Buttons Big enough to click
   - Most important things first
   - Make a human use the site on multiple devices, they will tell you what is wrong with it (Someone who will give you honest feedback)
